What does OTA mean?
OTA = Over The Air
In pieces, you can easily update your N.E.A.K. kernel directly from your phone without even using a PC and/or a Browser to download it from our servers and flash it manually. All will be done automatically and also pretty fast.

In the newest versions of uNEAK Engine, i have introduced a new OTA Updater tab of the app, completely written from scratch (no code ported, all original), to suit N.E.A.K. users necessities and make life easier.

On first open of the tab, you will be prompted to choose your actual recovery (installed on your phone). Currently supported are CWM and TWRP (the 2 most common).
You CANNOT skip this passage, or the app won't work properly for auto-flashing.

The main UI of the OTA Updater is pretty simple, Google OTA style. Just a simple button to manually check for updates, and on the top-right a SETTINGS button which i am going to explain now.

In the SETTINGS section of the updater, you can choose to automatically check for updates on phone boot, or every 6/12/24/48hrs. Pretty easy to use and configure.
If you have changed your recovery, or you set it wrong in the first step, there you can change it easily by clicking on the "Recovery Used" tab.

Once the app finds an update automatically, or you check manually for updates, you will be prompted with an Alert Dialog to download it now or later. If you choose to download now, after the download, you will be prompted to install the update now or later. Choosing again now, the phone will reboot to recovery and automatically install the downloaded update for your device. If that doesn't happen, you can find the downloaded package at /sdcard/neak folder.


Thanks for reading! :D
